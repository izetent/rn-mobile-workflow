# rn-mobile-workflow

This repository is a multi-skill Codex repository for React Native mobile development, especially projects that also include Android and iOS native code.

It currently contains two skills:

- `skills/rn-mobile-workflow`
- `skills/rn-native-bridge`
- `skills/bug-investigation-workflow`

## Skills

### `rn-mobile-workflow`

Use for end-to-end React Native mobile work across RN, Android, and iOS.

Focus:

- root-cause-first debugging
- separating RN, bridge, Android, and iOS ownership
- build and integration issues
- feed, playback, scroll, and rendering performance
- deciding whether a bug belongs in RN or native

Path:

```text
skills/rn-mobile-workflow
```

### `rn-native-bridge`

Use for bridge-specific work involving Native Modules, Native Components, TurboModules, Fabric, JSI, event design, command design, viewport sizing, and cross-layer ownership.

Focus:

- bridge API shape
- event and command boundaries
- index versus stable identity
- host size versus native viewport size
- high-frequency visual sync ownership
- bridge lifecycle and thread expectations

Path:

skills/rn-native-bridge
```

### `bug-investigation-workflow`

Use for bug fixing tasks where Codex must investigate before editing, gather evidence, add temporary logs when needed, decide whether to present multiple options first, and always close the loop with verification.

Focus:

- root cause versus symptom
- evidence-first debugging
- temporary logging and narrow instrumentation
- direct minimal fixes when the cause is clear
- option comparison when multiple fixes are valid
- regression-aware verification

## Install in Codex

If your Codex environment supports GitHub skill installation by repository path, install the specific skill directory you want.

Repository:

```text
https://github.com/izetent/rn-mobile-workflow.git
```

Skill paths:

```text
skills/rn-mobile-workflow
skills/rn-native-bridge
skills/bug-investigation-workflow
```

If you install manually, clone the repo and copy the skill directory you need into your local Codex skills directory.

Example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/izetent/rn-mobile-workflow.git /tmp/rn-mobile-workflow
cp -R /tmp/rn-mobile-workflow/skills/rn-mobile-workflow ~/.codex/skills/rn-mobile-workflow
cp -R /tmp/rn-mobile-workflow/skills/rn-native-bridge ~/.codex/skills/rn-native-bridge
cp -R /tmp/rn-mobile-workflow/skills/bug-investigation-workflow ~/.codex/skills/bug-investigation-workflow
```

Then restart Codex.

## Trigger examples

```text
Use rn-mobile-workflow to analyze why this RN feed stutters on Android but not iOS.

Use rn-native-bridge to review this TurboModule API design.

Use rn-native-bridge to determine whether this layout mismatch is caused by RN host size, native viewport size, or content render mode.

Use bug-investigation-workflow to investigate this bug before editing, add temporary logs if needed, and only fix it after the root cause is confirmed.
```

## Language

The skills are written in English for broader reuse.
